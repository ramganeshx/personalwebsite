      "Built a Discord bot that plays music in voice channels, allowing users to request songs by name. The bot searches both Spotify and YouTube APIs to find and stream songs. Over 25 users used my bot across various Discord servers. On average, it processes 35 - 40 song requests daily. It is built using a established comprehensive framework for handling API authentication and error management for Spotify and YouTube Data APIs, thus resulting close to a 50% reduction in troubleshooting time and increasing development efficiency."
